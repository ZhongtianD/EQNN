# Equivariant quantum neural networks
This repository aims to implement the Equivariant Quantum machine-learning model in various symmetries.

The Notebooks directory contains jupyter notebooks of my implementations using pennylane.

The data directory contains sample training data for the SO(2) invariant network as well as trained parameters for the discrete case.
