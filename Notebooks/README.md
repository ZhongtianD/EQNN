These are a collection of jupyter notebooks that I have developed.
EQNN_discrete.ipynb demonstrates the simplest discrete and invariant case with detailed explanations. EQNN_discrete_Asymm.ipynb uses the same symmetry except it is not completely invariant under the symmetry transformation.
SU(2)_untrainable.ipynb is an attempt on testing the mathematical formulations of an SU(2) invariant circuit structure even though it is not trainable.
SU(2)_trainable.ipynb is an alternative implementation of the SU(2) invariant circuit structure which makes it now trainable.
EQNN_SO(2).ipynb is an implementation and testing on SO(2) i.e. 2D rotational invariant quantum circuit, which is also trainable.
